Welcome to **Project 2026** — or P2026 for short.

This is my home base for tracking everything I'm building, launching, and learning this year. Think of it less like a traditional blog and more like a running log: part project journal, part launch tracker, part brain dump.

## What this site is

Each time I start something new — a side project, a tool, an experiment — I'll document it here. You'll find:

- **Blog posts** covering thoughts, process, and writeups
- **A timeline** of milestones and launches (think git log, but for my life)
- **Resources** I keep coming back to
- And eventually, links out to the individual projects themselves

## Why 2026?

Starting fresh with a year as a container felt right. Goals, constraints, a built-in deadline. Let's see what gets shipped.

If you're here, you probably know me. But if you stumbled in — welcome. Stick around.
